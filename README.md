# GSN Imagebank - Repository for Global Storybooks Images

This repository contains images adapted from the [African Storybook](https://www.africanstorybook.org) collection by the [Global Storybooks](https://globalstorybooks.net) project.

The images here include both those that have been modified (e.g., by colourization, cropping, etc.), as well as unmodified images. A repository containing only the modified images can be found [here](https://github.com/global-asp/asp-imagebank-new/), while the original, unmodified images can be found in the [asp-imagebank](https://github.com/global-asp/asp-imagebank) repository.

## License

All of the original images were released by the African Storybook under an open license. These modifications follow those licenses (either CC BY or CC BY-NC). A list of the licenses applying to each set of images is below, arranged by story index number:
